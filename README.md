# NIST Gamma Data
NIST Gamma Data is an Android application to search Gamma ray attenuation data from locally saved NIST files.

The advantage over the original website is:
	(Of course) offline data accessary;
	Faster approach;
	Most importantly, it can search for the best shielding material based on user specification!
